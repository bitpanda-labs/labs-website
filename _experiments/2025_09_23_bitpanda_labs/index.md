# From Vision to Labs

Over the past year, our AI journey has gained serious momentum. It started with internal tooling like our AI Slackbots 
that summarises threads, rewrites messages, and integrates tightly into our workflows. Then came more ambitious 
experiments like Bitpanda Coach, our AI-powered financial expert that helps users understand investing, one question 
at a time.
<br><br>
Along the way, we’ve run internal hackathons, hosted AI tinkerer events, and explored how AI can change the way we build 
products. But we kept running into the same problem: we’re not a 3-person startup anymore.
<br><br>
We have 800+ employees, a robust compliance framework, and a reputation to protect. That means features need reviews, 
testing, documentation, sometimes even regulatory clearance. In short: we can’t just YOLO stuff into prod.
<br><br>
But what if there was a place where we could experiment more freely, exploring any new technology or feature that 
sparked our curiosity?


# What is Bitpanda Labs?

Bitpanda Labs is our answer to that question. It’s a public space where we publish experimental features, some 
customer-facing, some just for Pandas. Think of it like a sandbox:
<br>
<br>⚡️ Some things might break.
<br>🔄 Some features may disappear again.
<br>🧪 But every project exists to learn fast and explore what’s possible.
<br><br>
AI's rapid pace, far exceeding traditional product roadmaps, first illuminated a critical bottleneck in our innovation 
process. To stay ahead, we need a team that prototypes ideas before we know if they’re feasible, scalable, or even a 
good idea. Labs gives us the freedom to explore the “what ifs,” not just for AI, but for any new technology or feature, 
without being constrained by the "perfect process." while of course still keeping our SDLC secure and compliant.
<br><br>
At its core, **Bitpanda Labs isn’t about perfection, it’s about progress**. We’re here to test, break, learn, and 
eventually, ship the future of investing, one experiment at a time.
