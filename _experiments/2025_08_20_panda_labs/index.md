## Why Postmortems Matter

Postmortems are structured reviews after an incident (like a service outage or bug in production). The idea is simple: 
analyse what happened, understand why, and define clear steps to prevent it in the future.

At Bitpanda these are mandatory to make sure we're always improving. They're not about pointing fingers, theyâ€™re about 
understanding what went wrong and how to prevent it from happening again.
